**How It Works**

*Initialize Account:* When the application starts, a BankAccount object is created with an initial balance.

*Create ATM:* An ATM object is instantiated to interact with the BankAccount.

*GUI Setup:* The ATMGUI class sets up the JavaFX interface, arranging the title, balance display, 
input field, buttons, and message area in a visually appealing layout.

**User Interactions:**

*Withdraw:* Users enter an amount and click the "Withdraw" button to withdraw money from their account. 
The system checks if the amount is valid and within the account balance.

*Deposit:* Users enter an amount and click the "Deposit" button to deposit money into their account. The system checks if the amount is valid.

*Check Balance:* Users click the "Check Balance" button to view their current account balance.

*Feedback:* The application provides feedback messages for each action, indicating success or failure.

**Running the Project**

To run the project, ensure you have JavaFX configured in your IDE. You can then compile and run the ATMGUI class as the main entry point of the application.
